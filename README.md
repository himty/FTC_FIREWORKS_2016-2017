# FTC_FIREWORKS_2016-2017

This is the repository for the FTC team FIREWORKS. If you are a team member, hello! If you are an internet wanderer, we welcome you and hope you find our repo informational!

## Note:
Our robot uses the LinearOpMode template, so all the updated files (HardwareTest, AutonomousTest, and TeleopTest) are needed to run the full program.
